# BerzerkLevels


One of the most popular games of all time was Dangerous Dave, a 2D platformer where you had to jump around, collect the key and then open the door. We decided to go a step further with our game Berzerk Levels. Berzerk Levels is a 2D platformer brain teaser game made for android. The protagonist of our game is an explorer who got stuck in an endless loop of the same setting and the only way to escape is to solve all the puzzles and escape, However, he cannot do so on his own and needs your help to do so. Featuring a surprise ending, our game consists of 30 unique levels each a different puzzle on its own - all of which need to be completed before the hero can escape. We use different physics and interactive features for each level so you need to personally get involved in the game to solve the puzzles. The 30 levels range from super jump to changing gravity and will take across the moon and beyond before you can complete the game. We have tried to make the game challenging by adding unique twists to all the levels making each level test your ability to solve the puzzle or your hand eye coordination.
